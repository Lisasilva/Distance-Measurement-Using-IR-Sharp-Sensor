# Distance-Measurement-Using-IR-Sharp-Sensor

The distance measurement system is designed using LPC 1768 to process the sensor data and 
display the distance on an LCD screen. A circuit board is developed to interface the sensor with the 
LCD display. The design methodology is based on measuring the time taken by the IR signal to 
bounce back from the object, and then calculating the distance using the speed of light. The output 
of the sensor is an analog voltage that varies according to the distance of the object. To measure the 
distance accurately, the analog voltage output of the sensor needs to be converted to a digital signal 
using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and then processed using the microcontroller. The tools 
used for the project include the IR sharp sensor, LCD display, LPC 1768, and the necessary software 
and programming languages.
The results obtained from the project show that the IR sharp sensor is an effective and accurate 
tool for distance measurement. The system is able to measure distances accurately in a range of 
lighting conditions and has potential applications in a variety of fields.
